# Google Calendar extension

### This extension displays data from your Google Calendar without any auth. It also allows you to parse working hours from Upwork "Work diary". In order to do this, you need to visit `https://www.upwork.com/ab/workdiary/freelancer/#/<you_id>/<yyyymmdd>/mine`, open the extension (click the extension icon in right top) and click the "Parse" button. Worktime will parsed and added to your calendar automatically. Events will added to the `<YOUR_PREFERED_CALENDAR_ID>` calendar (you need to set this variable in the `constants.js`).
